      "content": "Universities competing for enrollment and funding now differentiate themselves through trust credentials. Graduate programs that document rigorous academic integrity frameworks attract students concerned about credential value. Administrators position integrity policies as competitive advantages rather than compliance burdens. Institutions that build systematic trust verification gain leverage in markets where reputation determines viability. Faculty who understand this shift advocate for integrity investments that strengthen institutional positioning.",
