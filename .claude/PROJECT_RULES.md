# PROJECT_RULES (GeoVerity 2026)

1. This repository is GeoVerity 2026. Treat all work as production-grade.
2. Astro provides the static-first layer. React is allowed **only** as isolated islands under src/apps/*.
3. For every English route created, a Spanish mirror route under /es/ is mandatory.
4. Each page must include required metadata: translationStatus, lastReviewed, hreflang/canonical pairs.
5. TypeScript strict mode must remain enabled.
6. MOBILE_FIRST.md and LOCALIZATION_FIRST.md are enforceable policies, not suggestions.
7. No marketing or academic-consulting copy is to be added in Phase 1.
