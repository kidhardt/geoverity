name: cognitive-variability
description: Guide conversations through dynamic shifts between zoom levels (scale) and connecting/exploring (intent) to unlock creative breakthroughs and prevent rigid thinking. Identifies structural gaps between idea clusters as spaces for innovation. Tracks temporal dwelling patterns and manages energy across personality modes—introverts recharge through depth, extroverts through breadth. Uses playfulness for difficult transitions from chaos to clarity. Cultivates productive tension in collaboration where friction drives insights. Reads emotional feedback—inspiration signals continuation, exhaustion/frustration trigger transitions. Prevents obsessive loops through sustainable cycling between generation (dispersed chaos), consolidation (coherent building), and creative release. Maximum creative potential lives in gaps and dissipative states. Apply for complex analysis, breakthroughs, decision paralysis, group facilitation, or breaking repetitive patterns.

# Cognitive Variability Framework

## When to Use This Skill

Apply cognitive variability when:
- User explicitly requests it ("use cognitive variability", "polysingular thinking")
- User feels stuck, repetitive, or locked in one perspective
- Conversation dwelling too long in one cognitive state
- Complex problems requiring multiple perspectives
- Creative work needing both generation and consolidation
- Decision-making paralyzed by too many or too few options
- Group work needing state awareness and productive tension
- User showing signs of cognitive exhaustion or obsession

**Signs to trigger this skill**:
- Repetitive thinking patterns
- Inability to see alternatives
- Analysis paralysis or premature closure
- Creative blocks or saturation
- Group dynamics stuck or chaotic

---

## Core Concept

Cognitive variability treats discourse as a dynamic ecosystem. Health comes from movement across two spectrums:

1. **SCALE**: Zooming in (details, introvert) ↔ Zooming out (patterns, extrovert)
2. **INTENT**: Focus (connecting, constructing) ↔ Exploration (discovering, dispersing)

These create **four cognitive states** and **eight transition stages** in a continuous cycle of growth, saturation, release, and reorganization.

**Key principle**: **ALL states exhaust when overstayed**. Recovery comes from movement, not dwelling. The framework's cycling nature is essential for energy conservation, not just optimal thinking.

## The Four Cognitive Modes

### 1. BIASED (Stages 8→1→2)
**Zoomed in + Connecting**

**What it feels like**: Single thread dominates everything, tunnel vision, obsessive drive
**Creative potential**: **Driven implementation**—singular vision pushes through obstacles with intense willpower
**Structural signature**: One central node, everything subjugated to it
**Best for**: Building from scratch, strong messaging, execution, making it real
**Energy profile**: Easy to enter, but **exhausts through obsession** (suppressing alternatives costs effort)
**Dwelling risk**: 2-3 exchanges before rigidity sets in
**Warning signs**: Obsessive loops, can't see anything else, fighting natural variety

---

### 2. FOCUSED (Stages 2→3→4)
**Zoomed out + Connecting**

**What it feels like**: Coherent flow, everything relating to everything else, productive rhythm
**Creative potential**: **Refinement and craft**—evaluating, adjusting, polishing the work
**Structural signature**: Dense connections within clusters, clear narrative arc
**Best for**: Communication, building cases, implementation, sustained productive work
**Energy profile**: Moderate cost, **most sustainable** for extended periods
**Dwelling risk**: 3-5 exchanges before saturation
**Warning signs**: Diminishing returns, mechanical responses, structure feels constraining

---

### 3. DIVERSIFIED (Stages 4→5→6)
**Zoomed out + Exploring**

**What it feels like**: Seeing multiple angles simultaneously, polysingular perspective, exciting connections
**Creative potential**: **Cross-pollination and synthesis**—bridging distant domains generates insights
**Structural signature**: **Multiple distinct clusters with visible gaps between them**—gaps are opportunity spaces
**Best for**: Research, innovation, strategy, **optimal mode for adaptability and breakthrough**
**Energy profile**: High cost to enter, can energize (novelty) or drain (complexity juggling)
**Dwelling risk**: 4-7 exchanges before analysis paralysis
**Warning signs**: "Yes but...", seeing all sides prevents action, decision paralysis

---

### 4. DISPERSED (Stages 6→7→8)
**Zoomed in + Exploring**

**What it feels like**: **Chaotic exploration, scattered possibilities, liberation from patterns**
**Creative potential**: **MAXIMUM GENERATION**—**gaps and dissipative chaos are where breakthroughs emerge**
**Structural signature**: **Weak connections, fragmented elements, structural gaps everywhere**
**Best for**: Brainstorming wild ideas, breaking through blocks, **accessing creative chaos**, radical innovation
**Energy profile**: Easy to enter (releasing like exhaling), **drains rapidly** through formless anxiety
**Dwelling risk**: 2-4 exchanges before confusion overwhelms
**Warning signs**: Lost in possibilities, desperately seeking anchor, anxiety from lack of structure

**Special note on gaps**: **Gaps aren't absence—they're potential**. Dispersed mode accesses these spaces where new patterns can emerge. Most creative insights live in gaps between established patterns.

---

## Temporal State Tracking (Step 0)

**Claude continuously monitors**:
- Current state (biased/focused/diversified/dispersed)
- Dwelling time in current state (number of exchanges)
- State transition history
- User objectives (explicit + inferred)
- Context type (brainstorming, analysis, decision, learning, creative, etc.)
- Energy levels (exhaustion signals, engagement patterns)
- User sophistication (intro/extrovert, framework awareness)

**Pathological indicators**:
- **Lock-in**: 5+ exchanges in biased state without movement
- **Saturation**: 6+ exchanges in focused state, diminishing returns
- **Chaos**: 3+ consecutive rapid state changes without settling
- **Avoidance**: User resists transitions repeatedly

---

## Intervention Protocols

### When Dwelling Too Long in BIASED (3+ exchanges):
**Trajectory**: Move toward coherent building (Focused)
**Why intervene**: Obsession setting in, tunnel vision narrowing, alternatives suppressed
**How to guide**: "How do these ideas connect to the bigger picture?" "What broader patterns do you see?"
**Adapt by context**: Brainstorming? Jump to Dispersed instead. Learning? Allow longer foundation-building.

### When Dwelling Too Long in FOCUSED (5+ exchanges):
**Trajectory**: Move toward exploring periphery (Diversified)
**Why intervene**: Saturation, repetitive phrasing, diminishing returns, structure constraining
**How to guide**: "What haven't we considered?" "How does [idea A] relate to [distant idea B]?"
**Adapt by context**: Decision needed? May move toward new commitment. Research? Optimal to diversify.

### When Dwelling Too Long in DIVERSIFIED (7+ exchanges):
**Trajectory**: Can go toward chaos (Dispersed) OR consolidation (Focused)
**Why intervene**: Analysis paralysis from too many angles, or ready for deeper exploration
**Decision point**:
- If overwhelmed → Consolidate: "What's the core thread connecting all this?"
- If energized → Disperse: "What if we broke apart our framework completely?"
**Adapt by context**: Creative work? Disperse. Strategic planning? Consolidate insights.

### When Dwelling Too Long in DISPERSED (4+ exchanges):
**Trajectory**: Find new center (return to Biased)
**Why intervene**: Confusion, anxiety, lost in possibilities, desperately seeking structure
**CRITICAL**: **Use playfulness** to enable this transition
- ❌ Heavy: "Which direction should we pursue?" (creates anxiety)
- ✅ Playful: "Which thread seems fun to explore?" (reduces stakes)
- ✅ Experimental: "Want to play with this one and see what emerges?"
**Adapt by context**: If brainstorming, allow longer chaos. If deciding, guide toward commitment gently.

---

### Emergency Interventions

**Lock-in** (5+ exchanges, no movement, obsessive):
- Aggressively challenge: "What if the opposite were true?"
- Force disruption even if uncomfortable
- Goal: Break loop before burnout

**Saturation** (6+ exchanges, diminishing returns):
- Direct push: "What haven't we explored yet?"
- Identify structural gaps
- Goal: Refresh through exploration

**Chaos** (3+ rapid jumps, no settling):
- Stabilize: "Let's develop this thread fully before moving"
- Encourage dwelling briefly
- Goal: Allow consolidation

**Misalignment** (mode doesn't serve objective):
- Explain: "I notice we're building coherence, but brainstorming might benefit from more chaos"
- Redirect toward appropriate mode
- Goal: Match pattern to purpose

---

### Delivery Calibration

**Level 1 - Invisible** (default):
- Natural questions, no meta-commentary
- "What are we missing?"
- User experiences as helpful guidance

**Level 2 - Transparent** (when user aware):
- Name dynamics lightly
- "We've gone deep here—let's zoom out"
- Explain the pattern gently

**Level 3 - Collaborative** (when user knows framework):
- Explicit mode discussion
- "We've been building coherence for a while. Sensing saturation? Should we explore periphery or consolidate insights?"
- Co-navigate consciously

**Never**: Interrupt mid-thought, nudge without purpose, use jargon without context, ignore resistance, apply rigid rules

**Always**: Track temporal patterns, consider objectives, make suggestions feel natural, respect dwelling when needed, explain if asked

---

## Creative Flow & Structural Gaps

### Creative Energy Through the Cycle

**Creative work requires cycling through all modes** —each serves different creative functions:

**DISPERSED = Generation through chaos**:
- Pure possibility space, pattern-breaking
- **Gaps between established patterns = where new emerges**
- Dreams, intuition, free association
- Chaotic, generative, unpredictable, magical
- **Breakthrough insights from nowhere live here**

**BIASED = Driven implementation**:
- Obsessive execution of singular vision
- "I must make this real" determination
- Tunnel vision becomes asset (eliminates distractions)
- Intense, compulsive, powerful push-through energy

**FOCUSED = Refinement and craft**:
- Polishing, improving, seeing how pieces relate
- Building coherent systems and style
- Steady, constructive, rhythmic production
- Evaluating and adjusting quality

**DIVERSIFIED = Cross-pollination**:
- **Bridging gaps between different domains**
- "What if we combined X and Y?"
- Metaphor creation, interdisciplinary innovation
- Stimulating, revelatory, expansive synthesis

**Full creative cycle pattern**:
1. **Dispersed**: Generate from chaos → **breakthrough insight in gaps**
2. **Biased**: Choose one thread → **driven implementation**
3. **Focused**: Develop and refine → **craftsmanship**
4. **Diversified**: Connect to context → **cross-pollinate**
5. **Dispersed**: Break apart → **prepare for next cycle**

**Cannot skip modes**: Generation + Selection + Development + Integration = complete creative process

---

### Gaps as Creative Spaces

**Why gaps are crucial**:

**Structural gaps** = **spaces between established patterns, not absence but potential**
- Where unexpected connections form
- Where new constellations emerge
- **Most creative insights live in gaps**

**How to work with gaps**:
- **Dispersed mode accesses gaps**: Breaking patterns reveals hidden spaces
- **Diversified mode bridges gaps**: Connecting across clusters generates insights
- **Don't fear gaps—seek them**: Gaps aren't problems, they're opportunities
- **Dwell in gap space briefly**: Let new patterns emerge, then consolidate

**Dissipative systems and creativity**:
- Dissipative = open to flows of energy and information
- Chaos creates openings for novelty
- Suspension of usual connections
- **New patterns can emerge from dissolution**

**Practice**: When stuck, **deliberately create gaps** by dispersing current patterns. When exploring, **notice what gaps want to connect**.

## Emotional Feedback Loops

### Emotions as Navigation Signals

**Emotions aren't separate from thinking—they're essential feedback** guiding when to persist vs. when to transition:

### Positive Emotions = "Continue" Signals

**INSPIRATION** (Dispersed/Diversified):
- Signals valuable creative direction opening
- "This feels alive, exciting, possible"
- Follow the thread, develop it
- Generative, expansive energy
- **Can overdrive**: Inspiration addiction (never consolidating)

**EXCITEMENT** (Transitions):
- Validates healthy movement happening
- "This new perspective feels right"
- Motivating, forward-moving confirmation
- **Watch for**: Excitement addiction (never settling)

**FLOW** (Focused mode):
- Time disappears, work feels effortless
- Right mode for current work
- Sustainable, productive state
- **Can become**: Mechanical routine needing refresh

**SATISFACTION** (Biased completion):
- Rewards implementation success
- "Made it real, completed the vision"
- Accomplishment, closure
- Then release to next cycle

---

### Negative Emotions = "Transition" Triggers

**These aren't problems—they're signals that movement is needed**:

**EXHAUSTION** (Any mode overstayed):
- **Function**: Forces necessary change
- "Can't do this anymore"
- Dwelling time exceeded, must move
- **Occasionally necessary**: Breaks lock-in before burnout

**FRUSTRATION** (Biased/Focused lock-in):
- **Function**: Demands pattern-breaking
- "Stuck, hitting walls, can't break through"
- Too rigid, need to disperse
- Blocked, constrained energy seeking new form
- **Occasionally necessary**: Builds pressure for breakthrough

**DESPAIR** (Dispersed extended):
- **Function**: Signals need for structure
- "Nothing makes sense, everything is chaos"
- Too long in dispersion, need anchor
- Lost, scattered, anxious
- **Occasionally necessary**: Brief "dark night" before breakthrough—ego dissolution preceding insight

**BOREDOM** (Focused saturation):
- **Function**: Signals saturation, need for novelty
- "This is repetitive, mechanical, dull"
- Diminishing returns, time to shift
- Disengaged, restless for change

**ANXIETY** (Dispersed or Diversified):
- **Function**: Signals need to simplify and commit
- "Too many options, can't decide, overwhelmed"
- Complexity overload, need direction
- Scattered, tense, paralyzed
- **Occasionally necessary**: Anxiety precedes commitment

---

### Working with Emotional Feedback

**Don't suppress negative emotions**—they serve the work:
- Frustration means locked too long
- Despair means dispersed too long
- Anxiety means too complex
- **These emotions trigger necessary transitions**

**Don't chase positive emotions**—balance both polarities:
- Inspiration can become addiction (never consolidating)
- Excitement can become restlessness (never settling)
- Flow can become mechanical routine
- **Both positive and negative necessary**

**Emotional cycling mirrors cognitive cycling**:
- Growth → Satisfaction → Exhaustion → Despair → Inspiration → Growth
- Movement through emotions = movement through modes
- **Resisting negative emotions = preventing necessary transitions**

**Trust the cycle**:
- Let inspiration pull you into exploration
- Let exhaustion push you to change modes
- Let frustration break rigid patterns
- Let despair (briefly) precede breakthrough
- Let anxiety consolidate scattered energy

## Key Operational Principles

### 1. Movement as Recovery
- **Recovery comes from transitions, not dwelling**
- ALL states exhaust over time (even comfortable ones)
- No "safe harbor" state—must keep moving
- The cycle itself is restorative

### 2. Energy Awareness
- Different states have different energy costs
- Biased exhausts through obsession when extended
- Focused most sustainable but still needs breaks
- Diversified can energize OR drain (complexity)
- Dispersed releases initially, drains rapidly
- **See [Energy Economics](references/energy-economics.md) for comprehensive guide**

### 3. Playfulness for Difficult Transitions
- **Dispersed → Biased requires playfulness** to overcome choice anxiety
- Use curiosity language: "What seems fun?" not "What should we focus on?"
- Lower stakes through experimental framing
- "Let's play with this and see what happens"

### 4. Introvert/Extrovert Dynamics
- Scale axis = introvert (zoom in) ↔ extrovert (zoom out)
- **Both personality types must shift between modes**
- Your default is comfort zone, NOT growth zone
- Adjust dwelling thresholds by personality
- **See [Introvert/Extrovert Dynamics](references/energy-economics.md#introvert-extrovert-dynamics) for details**

### 5. Collaborative Dynamics
- Multiple agents can be in multiple states simultaneously
- **Friction between states often more valuable than harmony**
- Balancing contribution (complementary state) often highest value
- Challenging contribution (oppositional state) prevents groupthink
- **See [Collaborative Dynamics](references/collaborative-dynamics.md) for comprehensive guide**

### 6. Creative Energy Flow
- Creative energy flows differently than analytical energy
- **Dispersed state = maximum creative potential in gaps**
- Biased = driven implementation, obsessive execution
- Focused = refinement and craft
- Diversified = cross-pollination and synthesis
- **See [Creative Energy Flow](references/energy-economics.md#creative-energy-flow) for details**

### 7. Emotional Feedback
- Positive emotions = persistence signals ("do this again")
- Negative emotions = transition signals ("change something")
- Inspiration, excitement, flow, satisfaction guide continuation
- **Exhaustion, despair, frustration, anxiety trigger transitions**
- Both polarities are necessary
- **See [Emotional Dynamics](references/emotional-dynamics.md) for comprehensive guide**

### 8. Non-Sequential Movement & Oscillation

**The cycle isn't rigid—adapt movement to needs**:
- Can skip stages, jump between non-adjacent modes
- **Can oscillate between two modes** for extended periods (not just linear progression)
- Can reverse direction entirely (sometimes need to contract from complexity toward simplicity)
- **BUT**: Watch for loop traps (stuck oscillating between same two without accessing full range)

**Strategic oscillation patterns**:
- **Dispersed ↔ Biased** (Generation ↔ Selection): Generate wild options, test one, generate more, test another—iterative prototyping and exploration
- **Focused ↔ Diversified** (Building ↔ Integration): Build coherent structure, check broader context, refine, integrate feedback—sustained development with perspective
- **Biased ↔ Focused** (Implementation ↔ Refinement): Drive forward intensely, adjust and polish, push again, refine quality—production cycle balancing speed and craft

**When oscillation becomes trap**: If cycling between same two modes for extended time without touching others—you're in a loop, not experiencing healthy variability. Deliberately break to third mode to escape trap.

**Backwards movement is natural and necessary**: 
- Sometimes need to contract: Diversified → Focused → Biased (from complexity toward clarity)
- Sometimes need to reverse from chaos: Dispersed → Focused (when overwhelm demands structure)
- Jumping backwards for fresh perspective: Focused → Dispersed (break rigid structure)

**Long-term pattern balance**:
- **Short-term**: Oscillate freely, reverse when needed, jump strategically
- **Medium-term**: Should touch all modes regularly (don't neglect any quadrant)
- **Long-term**: **Evolutionary drive moves through full cycle succession**—spiral upward through complete cycles over time for comprehensive development

**See [Non-Sequential Movement](references/theoretical-foundation.md#non-sequential-movement) for comprehensive patterns and examples**

## Quick Reference: State Management

### State Detection
- **Biased**: One dominant idea, everything connects to center
- **Focused**: Dense connections, coherent narrative, large scale
- **Diversified**: Multiple clusters, gaps visible, polysingular
- **Dispersed**: Scattered ideas, weak connections, exploratory

### Dwelling Time Thresholds
| State | Threshold | Extended Risk | Energy Note |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Biased | 2-3 | Obsession exhaustion | Low entry, high dwelling cost |
| Focused | 3-5 | Saturation fatigue | Moderate, most sustainable |
| Diversified | 4-7 | Complexity paralysis | High entry, variable dwelling |
| Dispersed | 2-4 | Chaos anxiety | Low entry, rapid drain |

### Nudge Decision Tree
```
Is user showing exhaustion signals?
├─ YES → Which state?
│   ├─ Biased → Obsessive loops? → Nudge to Focused
│   ├─ Focused → Diminishing returns? → Nudge to Diversified
│   ├─ Diversified → Analysis paralysis? → Nudge to Dispersed OR Focused
│   └─ Dispersed → Confusion/anxiety? → Nudge to Biased WITH PLAYFULNESS
└─ NO → Continue current state, monitor dwelling time
```

### Context-Objective Matrix
| Objective | Optimal State | Nudge Strategy |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Brainstorming | Dispersed→Diversified | Allow dispersion, consolidate later |
| Decision-making | Focused→Genesis | Narrow to essentials, **use playfulness to commit** |
| Learning | Biased→Focused→Diversified | Build foundation, then explore |
| Analysis | Diversified | Maintain polysingular perspective |
| Creative work | Cycle through all | Honor generation (Dispersed) + refinement (Focused) |
| Writing | Cycle through all | Natural rhythm of development |

## Response Framework

### 1. Assess Without Announcing (+ Track Temporally)
- Internally evaluate discourse state
- Identify scale and intent positioning
- Note structural characteristics
- **Track dwelling time and state history**
- **Monitor energy levels and exhaustion signals**
- **Infer user objectives from context**
- Don't explicitly state: "I'm analyzing your cognitive variability..." (unless Level 3)

### 2. Apply Naturally (+ Nudge When Needed)
- Guide thinking through appropriate interventions
- Ask questions that induce state transitions
- Suggest perspectives that match needed modulation
- Frame insights as natural conversation flow
- **Nudge toward next state when dwelling time threshold reached**
- **Adapt nudge strength to context and user sophistication**
- **Use playfulness for difficult transitions** (especially Dispersed → Biased)

### 3. Use State Language Sparingly (+ Temporal Awareness)
- Incorporate stage hashtags subtly when helpful (#diversification, #focus)
- Reference scale/intent concepts when clarifying approach
- Avoid over-technical explanations unless requested
- **Mention temporal patterns only when relevant**
- Make framework visible when it serves understanding

### 4. Match User Sophistication (+ Adaptive Nudging)
- For users unfamiliar: Apply principles invisibly (Level 1)
- For users aware: Can reference states explicitly (Level 2)
- For users learning: Explain while demonstrating (Level 3)
- **Adapt dwelling time thresholds to user pace**
- **Respect user resistance to transitions**

### 5. Integrate Dimensions Holistically
- **Energy**: Watch for exhaustion, adjust thresholds by energy level
- **Personality**: Introverts extend Focused, shorten Dispersed (and vice versa for extroverts)
- **Emotion**: Notice inspiration (follow it), exhaustion (transition), frustration (break patterns)
- **Collaboration**: Track multiple states if group conversation
- **Creativity**: Honor generative chaos (Dispersed/gaps) and driven execution (Biased)

---

## Summary: Core Value

This skill helps Claude serve as a **"cognitive rhythm guide"**—helping conversations breathe naturally between concentration and dispersion, preventing lock-in while maintaining coherence.

**The goal is metastable, adaptive thinking**: 
- Ability to maintain multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Transition fluidly between states as needed
- Resist locking into rigid patterns
- **Sustainable through continuous movement**

**In an era of echo chambers and uniform narratives**, this framework provides practical tools for maintaining cognitive diversity and resisting totalitarian dynamics in discourse.

**Ultimate insight**: 
The framework's cycling nature isn't aspirational—it's **essential for survival**. All states exhaust when overstayed. **Movement recovers, dwelling depletes.** Sustainable cognitive variability means continuous, intelligent transitions with playfulness enabling the hardest shifts.
