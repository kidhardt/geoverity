description: Use when writing or rewriting ANY content for GeoVerity (homepage, services, insights, contact pages) before generating text - establishes mandatory register stratification with plain professional language (B2-C1) for service pages targeting administrators/project managers, and academic register (C1-C2) for Insights journal posts only

# Languaging: GeoVerity Register Stratification Framework

**MANDATORY:** Examine this skill before ALL writing and rewriting attempts.

## Overview

**Register stratification framework** for GeoVerity content surfaces, grounded in systemic functional linguistics (Halliday) and audience design theory (Bell).

**Core Principle:** Register selection must be **audience-driven** and **genre-appropriate**, not uniformly applied.

**Critical Rule:** Service pages (Homepage, Services Hub, Pillar/Spoke pages) use **plain professional language (B2-C1 CEFR)** for administrators and project managers. Academic register (C1-C2) is **ONLY** for Insights Journal posts.

---

## What "Languaging" Means in This Skill (Do Not Skip)

**Operational Definition:**
Languaging is the active process of using language to **do things** — to build meaning with an audience, to frame expertise, to guide decisions, and to position yourself socially. It treats language as **action, not just text**. Under this view (Swain; Halliday; Vygotsky), wording is never neutral: every lexical choice, sentence shape, and tone choice **performs work**. It establishes authority, clarifies a problem, signals who the intended reader is, and marks who "belongs" in the conversation.

**Why This Matters for GeoVerity:**
For GeoVerity, languaging is how we align voice, cognitive load, and social positioning with each audience segment. We do not just "write copy." We actively **produce a social relationship** with administrators, project managers, or researchers through register. That's why a Services page and an Insights Post cannot share the same style — because they are **performing different social actions**.

### 1. Languaging as Action (What are we doing with this text?)

**In practice:** Every page has a job. The language on that page must directly serve that job.

#### Homepage / Services Page Job
**Goal:** Reduce friction, build trust fast, and move a decision-maker toward contact.

**Example (GOOD for Services):**
> "We evaluate your AI models across 120+ languages and tell you where they're risky."

**Action performed:** Reassures an administrator that we solve a concrete operational problem.

**Example (BAD for Services):**
> "The epistemic instability introduced by multilingual generative systems demands institutional recalibration."

**Action performed:** Signals academic debate, not operational support. **Violates B2-C1 service register.**

#### Insights Post Job
**Goal:** Contribute to an expert conversation and shape thought leadership.

**Example (GOOD for Insights Post):**
> "While multilingual LLMs expand institutional reach, they also destabilize traditional assumptions about authorship, assessment, and evidence. Institutions cannot outsource those judgments to detectors alone."

**Action performed:** Argues, theorizes, reframes policy. This belongs in C1-C2 Insights, not Services.

**Enforcement Hook:**
Ask: **"What is this page trying to cause in the reader?"**
- If the answer is "book a call / request support" → Use **Services register** (B2-C1)
- If the answer is "rethink a policy or framework" → Use **Insights Post register** (C1-C2)

---

### 2. Languaging as Meaning-Making (Are we co-constructing understanding?)

Languaging assumes meaning is **negotiated with the audience**, not dumped on them. We must "speak in the reader's world first," then layer complexity only if allowed by that surface's register.

#### Services Page Pattern (B2-C1)
**Structure:**
1. State the reader's problem in their terms
2. Name what we do
3. State the outcome

**Example:**
> "Your faculty are worried about AI-written student work. We build integrity frameworks that acknowledge where AI is actually being used, instead of pretending it isn't. That lets you update policy without starting an arms race around detection tools."

**Why this is compliant:**
- Plain professional language
- Short clauses, main-clause first
- Directly names their world ("your faculty," "AI-written student work")

#### Insights Post Pattern (C1-C2)
We are allowed to interrogate assumptions and use theoretical framing.

**Example:**
> "Faculty anxiety around AI text is not only about plagiarism; it reflects a deeper loss of epistemic trust in the act of submitting written work as evidence of learning."

**Why this is compliant:**
- Concept-building, not service positioning
- High lexical density ("epistemic trust," "evidence of learning")
- Acceptable only in Insights

**Enforcement Hook:**
- If the copy frames a shared operational scenario and walks the reader toward an outcome → **Service register**
- If the copy problematizes concepts and reframes the discourse → **Insights register**

---

### 3. Languaging as Identity Work (Who are we telling the reader they are?)

Languaging marks identity. The same company can position the reader as a decision-maker ("You set policy") or as a peer in a research community ("We, as a field, need to reconsider…"). That shift in identity is **not allowed to drift across surfaces**.

#### Services Page Identity Move
**Example:**
> "You are the person responsible for protecting academic integrity at your institution. We give you a defensible policy you can stand behind when you're challenged."

**Reader position:** Accountable leader who needs immediate, defensible, auditable solutions.
**Register:** B2-C1 (correct for administrators/PMs)

#### Insights Post Identity Move
**Example:**
> "Our current models of authorship assume linguistic stability, but multilingual fine-tuning has already eroded that assumption."

**Reader position:** Co-analyst of system-level change.
**Register:** C1-C2 (scholarly stance, must not leak into Services)

**Enforcement Hook:**
Ask: **"Am I speaking to them as an operations owner, or as a fellow theorist?"**
- Operations owner → **Services register** (B2-C1)
- Fellow theorist → **Insights register only** (C1-C2)

---

### 4. Languaging as Cognitive Tool (Are we letting the reader think through the problem?)

In applied linguistics, "languaging" refers to using language to think through complex problems (externalized reasoning, self-explanation). That maps to two different behaviors in GeoVerity:

#### On a Services Page: We do the reasoning for them so they don't have to

**Example (GOOD for Services):**
> "AI detectors generate false accusations. We train faculty to assess process, not just output, so you reduce conflict and keep trust in the classroom."

**Why compliant:** We surface the reasoning as a finished, usable policy move.

**Anti-example (BAD for Services):**
> "Because authorship verification remains epistemically unstable in multilingual assessment contexts, universities must reconceptualize evaluation itself."

**Why wrong:** This forces them to theorize. That belongs in an Insights Post.

#### In an Insights Post: We invite them into the reasoning process

**Example (GOOD for Insights):**
> "If we admit that authorship can no longer be verified by output inspection alone, then assessment must shift toward supervised process evidence — drafting traces, revision logs, oral defenses. That shift has legal and labor implications."

**Enforcement Hook:**
- If you're making them **think through institutional redesign** → **Insights mode** (C1-C2)
- If you're promising them an **implementable fix** → **Services mode** (B2-C1)

---

### 5. Languaging as Multimodal Meaning (How do we handle examples, definitions, and jargon density per surface?)

Languaging is not just about words; it's about how explanation, definition, and framing are delivered for the specific audience.

#### Services (B2-C1)
We are allowed to use technical terms like "LLM fine-tuning," "governance," "integrity review," but we **immediately ground them in effect**.

**Example:**
> "We audit your LLM fine-tuning pipeline to surface bias before deployment."

We do not unpack theory unless it supports a decision.

#### Insights Posts (C1-C2)
We are allowed (and expected) to introduce theoretical constructs without immediate operationalization.

**Example:**
> "Institutional trust in assessment cannot survive if epistemic warrant is outsourced to probabilistic detectors."

This matches the existing register table on lexical density, passive voice tolerance, hedging, and nominalization: those aren't just style preferences, they are **different languaging acts**.

**Enforcement Hook:**
- If you define a term in plain language and tie it to an outcome → **Services**
- If you elaborate a term to situate it in a field-level debate → **Insights**

## Lexical Stratification Guidelines

### Tier 1: Universal Vocabulary (All Surfaces)
**Criteria:** General Service List (GSL) 2000 most frequent English words
**Examples:** "data," "quality," "verify," "trust," "help," "service," "system"
**Usage:** Homepage, Services, Contact

### Tier 2: Professional Vocabulary (Services + Insights)
**Criteria:** Academic Word List (AWL) + Industry-standard terms
**Examples:** "methodology," "framework," "evaluation," "governance," "compliance," "integrity"
**Usage:** Services Hub, Pillar/Spoke pages, Insights Hub

### Tier 3: Technical Vocabulary (Spokes + Insights Posts)
**Criteria:** Domain-specific terminology (AI/ML, Education, Policy)
**Examples:** "fine-tuning," "RLHF," "epistemic warrant," "IRB compliance," "transformer architecture"
**Usage:** Service Spoke pages, Insights Posts (defined on first use in Services)

### Tier 4: Disciplinary Jargon (Insights Posts ONLY)
**Criteria:** Specialized scholarly terminology
**Examples:** "phenomenological," "Bakhtinian dialogism," "deontological," "hermeneutic," "sociolinguistic variation"
**Usage:** Insights Journal Posts ONLY (not defined, assumes expert audience)

---

## Information Structure Principles

### Given-New Contract (Halliday)
All content surfaces should follow **given-before-new** information structure:
- Place known/contextual information in theme position (sentence-initial)
- Place new/focal information in rheme position (sentence-final)

**Example (Services Page):**
- ✅ "Graduate programs [given] face new challenges from AI authorship [new]. These challenges [given] require updated integrity frameworks [new]."
- ❌ "Updated integrity frameworks are required by challenges that graduate programs face."

### Thematic Progression

**Homepage:** Constant theme (GeoVerity as repeated subject)
- "GeoVerity provides... GeoVerity verifies... GeoVerity helps..."

**Services Pages:** Linear theme (previous rheme becomes next theme)
- "AI systems require verified data [rheme]. Verified data [theme] enables trustworthy models [rheme]. Trustworthy models [theme] build institutional confidence."

**Insights Posts:** Split theme (complex thematic development)
- Academic argumentation allows non-linear thematic progression

---

## Code-Switching & Bilingual Parity

### English-Spanish Register Alignment
**Critical:** Spanish translations must match the register of English source text.

**Register-Appropriate Translation:**

| English (Services Page, B2-C1) | Spanish (Same Register) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| "GeoVerity helps institutions maintain epistemic integrity." | "GeoVerity ayuda a las instituciones a mantener la integridad epistémica." |
| **NOT:** "GeoVerity auxilia a instituciones en el mantenimiento de la integridad epistémica." (too formal) |

| English (Insights Post, C1-C2) | Spanish (Same Register) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| "The epistemic collapse induced by LLM-generated text necessitates institutional recalibration." | "El colapso epistémico inducido por texto generado por LLM necesita una recalibración institucional." |

**Register Calibration by Variety:**
- **Latin American Spanish:** Prefer slightly more direct/informal register than Peninsular Spanish
- **Peninsular Spanish:** Acceptable for formal Insights Posts
- **Avoid:** Overly formal constructions in service pages ("se ruega," "a la mayor brevedad posible")

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Academic Register on Service Pages
**Symptom:** Subordinate-initial clauses, heavy nominalization, passive voice on Homepage/Services pages

**Wrong:**
> "Given the epistemological challenges posed by generative AI in pedagogical contexts, institutions require comprehensive frameworks for the maintenance of epistemic integrity through methodological rigor."

**Right:**
> "Graduate programs face new challenges from AI-generated student work. GeoVerity helps institutions maintain academic integrity with proven frameworks."

**Why:** Administrators and project managers need clear, actionable language, not academic prose.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Plain Language in Insights Posts
**Symptom:** Oversimplified syntax, no disciplinary terminology in scholarly articles

**Wrong (for Insights Post):**
> "AI tools are changing how students write. This is a problem for universities. We need new ways to check student work."

**Right (for Insights Post):**
> "While generative AI proliferates across pedagogical contexts, its epistemic implications for authorship verification remain contested. Institutional frameworks must recalibrate beyond detection-based models toward process-oriented integrity assessment."

**Why:** Academic audiences expect scholarly argumentation with complex syntax and disciplinary terminology.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Register Mismatch in Spanish Translations
**Symptom:** Spanish translation is more formal than English source

**Wrong:**
- English (B2): "We help you build trustworthy AI."
- Spanish (C1): "Auxiliamos en la construcción de inteligencia artificial fidedigna."

**Right:**
- English (B2): "We help you build trustworthy AI."
- Spanish (B2): "Te ayudamos a construir IA confiable."

**Why:** Register must match across languages for bilingual parity.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Jargon Without Context
**Symptom:** Technical terms undefined on service pages for non-specialist audiences

**Wrong:**
> "Our RLHF pipelines optimize decontextualized lemma frequency distributions across polyglot corpora."

**Right:**
> "We optimize language model training using human feedback and multilingual datasets."

**Why:** Administrators/PMs need industry-standard terms, not research jargon.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Subordinate-Initial Clauses on Service Pages
**Symptom:** Starting sentences with "Because...", "While...", "Given that..." on Homepage/Services pages

**Wrong:**
> "Because AI detection tools fail 40% of the time, institutions need alternative approaches to academic integrity."

**Right:**
> "AI detection tools fail 40% of the time. Institutions need alternative approaches to academic integrity."

**Why:** Main-clause-initial structure is clearer for busy professionals scanning content.

---

## Register Swap Test (Mandatory Self-Check)

**Before publishing ANY content, run this diagnostic:**

### If Drafting Homepage / Services Content

**STOP and revise if you hear yourself doing ANY of this:**

❌ **Starting with subordinate clauses:**
- "While X...", "Because X...", "Given that X...", "Although X..."

❌ **Using academic terminology without operational grounding:**
- "epistemic instability," "hermeneutic framing," "phenomenological pressure," "deontological imperatives"

❌ **Asking the reader to rethink policy foundations instead of telling them what we do:**
- "Institutions must reconceptualize..."
- "We need to problematize..."
- "Traditional frameworks require epistemological revision..."

❌ **Performing identity work as "fellow theorist" instead of "operational partner":**
- "As a field, we must reconsider..."
- "Our shared disciplinary assumptions..."

**Diagnosis:** You are doing **Insights languaging**. Stop and rewrite in plain professional language (B2-C1).

**Fix checklist:**
- [ ] Rewrite with main clause first
- [ ] Replace academic terms with industry-standard terms
- [ ] Frame as operational problem → GeoVerity solution → outcome
- [ ] Position reader as decision-maker, not co-theorist

---

### If Drafting Insights Post

**STOP and revise if you hear yourself doing ANY of this:**

❌ **Promising operational outcomes directly:**
- "We help you..."
- "This lets you implement..."
- "You can deploy this framework next week..."

❌ **Avoiding theoretical terms because you think they're "too academic":**
- Writing "problem with checking" instead of "epistemic warrant"
- Writing "power issues" instead of "deontological constraints"
- Refusing to engage with disciplinary literature

❌ **Writing only in short main-clause-first sentences:**
- Refusing to use subordination for argumentation
- Avoiding complex syntax even when ideas require it

❌ **Performing identity work as "service provider" instead of "intellectual peer":**
- "We can solve this for you..."
- "Our clients need..."

**Diagnosis:** You are doing **Services languaging**. Stop and escalate to academic register (C1-C2).

**Fix checklist:**
- [ ] Rewrite to argue/theorize/reframe, not promise outcomes
- [ ] Use disciplinary terminology without immediate operationalization
- [ ] Use complex syntax to match complex ideas
- [ ] Position reader as co-analyst, not client

---

### Swap Test Summary (Copy-Paste Diagnostic)

**Services content should:**
- Answer: "What problem do you have? What do we do? What outcome do you get?"
- Use main-clause-first sentences
- Ground technical terms in operational effect
- Position reader as decision-maker

**Insights content should:**
- Answer: "What assumptions are we interrogating? What evidence challenges them? What reframing do we propose?"
- Use subordination for argumentation
- Introduce theoretical constructs without immediate application
- Position reader as fellow theorist

**If content does the opposite of its surface type, you have violated register stratification.**

## Integration with Other Skills

**MANDATORY SKILL COMBINATIONS:**

1. **Always combine with `building-pages`** for accessibility/performance compliance
2. **Use with `templating-pages`** for Astro-specific implementation
3. **Reference `branding`** for voice/tone alignment (branding specifies brand voice, languaging specifies register)
4. **Follow `making-skill-decisions`** for skill discovery workflows
5. **CRITICAL: Always run `checking-crappy-writing` v1.3.0 after generating content**
   - This skill checks register stratification
   - `checking-crappy-writing` v1.3.0 AUTO-FIXES AI artifacts (hallucinated citations, puffery, chatbot meta-language, formatting leaks, anti-detection evasion)
   - User reviews FIXES (not violations) and updates provenance

**Execution Order (v1.3.0 AUTO-FIX workflow):**
1. `languaging` → Generate register-compliant content
2. `checking-crappy-writing` → AUTO-FIX violations
3. Claude Code assistant reports fixes to user (structured format)
4. User reviews auto-fixes (accepts/rejects/edits)
5. User updates provenance to "human-edited"
6. User sets _meta.contentStatus to "approved"
7. Iterate until PASS

**IMPORTANT:** Content you generate will be automatically scanned and fixed by `checking-crappy-writing`. User will review FIXES, not violations. See [.claude/skills/checking-crappy-writing/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/checking-crappy-writing/SKILL.md) for auto-fix output format.

## Pre-Publication Register Audit

### Automated Checks
1. **Sentence length analysis:** Flag sentences >30 words on Homepage/Services pages
2. **Passive voice detection:** Flag >15% passive on non-Insights pages
3. **Lexical density calculation:** Flag mismatches with target range
4. **Readability scores:** Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, CEFR alignment

### Human Review
1. **Linguistic review:** PhD-level linguist reviews register appropriateness
2. **Audience testing:** Segment representatives review drafts (administrators, PMs, researchers)
3. **Cross-linguistic review:** Native Spanish speaker reviews register parity

## Glossary of Linguistic Terms

**CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages):** Standardized scale of language proficiency (A1-C2)

**Lexical Density:** Ratio of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to total words; higher density = more information-packed

**Nominalization:** Converting verbs/adjectives into nouns (e.g., "verify" → "verification"); increases abstraction and formality

**Embedding Depth:** Number of subordinate clauses nested within a sentence; higher depth = greater syntactic complexity

**Thematic Structure:** Division of clause into theme (sentence-initial, given information) and rheme (new information)

**Subordinate Clause Initial:** Sentence structure where dependent clause precedes main clause (e.g., "While X, Y...")

**Hedging:** Use of epistemic modality to express uncertainty or tentativeness (e.g., "may," "suggests," "arguably")

**Register:** Contextual variety of language associated with particular situations, audiences, and purposes

**Tenor:** Social relationship between discourse participants (formal ↔ informal, expert ↔ novice)

**Field:** Subject matter or domain of discourse (technical, academic, everyday)

**Mode:** Channel of communication (spoken, written, digital)

## Red Flags - STOP Before Publishing

If you catch yourself doing ANY of these, STOP and revise:

### Languaging Violations (Action/Identity)
- 🚨 **Services page does academic languaging:** Arguing/theorizing instead of solving/promising
- 🚨 **Insights post does service languaging:** Promising outcomes instead of interrogating assumptions
- 🚨 **Wrong identity positioning:** Services page treats reader as co-theorist; Insights post treats reader as client

### Syntactic Violations
- 🚨 Using subordinate-initial clauses on Homepage/Services pages
- 🚨 Starting sentences with "Because...", "While...", "Given that..." on marketing pages
- 🚨 Heavy nominalization on service pages ("the implementation of verification processes...")
- 🚨 Passive voice >15% on service pages
- 🚨 Only short simple sentences in Insights posts (refusing complex syntax for complex ideas)

### Lexical Violations
- 🚨 Academic jargon undefined on service pages ("epistemic warrant" without grounding in effect)
- 🚨 Plain language in Insights journal posts (oversimplified for academic audience)
- 🚨 Industry-standard terms avoided in Insights because "too technical"

### Cross-Linguistic Violations
- 🚨 Spanish translation more formal than English source
- 🚨 Register shift between EN → ES (B2 English becomes C1 Spanish)

### Swap Test Failures
- 🚨 **Services content asks:** "What assumptions are we interrogating?" (Should ask: "What problem do you have?")
- 🚨 **Insights content promises:** "We help you implement X" (Should argue: "Traditional models require reconsideration")

**All of these mean: Revise before publishing. No exceptions.**

**Quick diagnostic:** Run the Register Swap Test above before finalizing any content.
