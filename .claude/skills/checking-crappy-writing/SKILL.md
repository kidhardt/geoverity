# checking-crappy-writing Skill v1.3.0
# AUTO-FIX FIRST, USER REVIEW AFTER

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW CHANGE (v1.3.0)

**OLD WORKFLOW (v1.2.0):** Flag violations ‚Üí User fixes ‚Üí Review
**NEW WORKFLOW (v1.3.0):** AUTO-FIX violations ‚Üí Report changes ‚Üí User reviews fixes

### Why This Change

Every lexical, phrasal, syntactic, and structural AI artifact is a serious credibility risk. Claude Code assistant now:

1. **Automatically fixes** detectable violations
2. **Reports** all changes to user in structured format
3. **Updates provenance** metadata to track AI-generated ‚Üí AI-generated-fixed
4. **User reviews** FIXES (not violations) and approves/rejects/edits
5. **Provenance enforcement** blocks commits until human review complete

---

## Purpose

This skill is a content hygiene gate targeting AI-generation artifacts that:
- undermine credibility or academic rigor
- introduce legal or compliance risk
- violate `languaging` register rules
- make copy read like a chatbot transcript

Indicators drawn from Wikipedia AI Cleanup guidance. Multiple violations = production block until fixed.

## Auto-Fix Strategy

### What Claude Code Assistant Auto-Fixes AUTOMATICALLY

#### Section 2 (Puffery): Replace promotional vocabulary
- "groundbreaking" ‚Üí "proven" / "established"
- "pioneering" ‚Üí "early" / "initial"
- "acclaimed" ‚Üí "recognized" / "noted"
- "seminal" ‚Üí "influential" / remove
- "transformative" ‚Üí "significant" / "meaningful"
- "renowned" ‚Üí "recognized" / "established"
- "celebrated" ‚Üí "noted" / remove
- "dynamic" ‚Üí "active" / remove

#### Section 4 (Templatey Discourse): Remove/rewrite patterns
- "Not just X, but Y" ‚Üí Remove negative parallelism, state Y directly
- "Moreover," / "Furthermore," / "Additionally," ‚Üí Remove boilerplate transitions or replace with "Also," / specific connectives
- "In conclusion," / "Overall," / "Ultimately," ‚Üí Remove or replace with direct statement
- "Here's what we'll cover:" ‚Üí Remove tutorial scaffolding

#### Section 6 (Formatting): Strip artifacts
- Remove emoji entirely (üî•, üöÄ, ‚úÖ, etc.)
- Convert curly quotes ‚Üí straight quotes
- Remove bold-colon bullets ("**Data Integrity:** We ensure‚Ä¶") ‚Üí plain prose
- Fix Title Case ‚Üí sentence case where appropriate
- **FLAG ONLY** (don't auto-fix): Textbook-perfect punctuation (requires human judgment)

#### Section 7 (Meta-chatbot): Remove AI self-reference
- "As an AI..." ‚Üí Remove entire sentence
- "I cannot access..." ‚Üí Remove disclaimer
- "As of my last training cutoff..." ‚Üí Remove
- "Happy to help!" ‚Üí Remove chatty assistance language
- "Here is your requested overview..." ‚Üí Remove meta-talk

#### Section 11 (Anti-detection): Fix awkward synonymy
- "facilitate epistemic evaluation" ‚Üí "verify claims"
- "institutions necessitate assistance" ‚Üí "institutions need help"
- "commence utilization" ‚Üí "start using"
- "systematic validation approaches" ‚Üí "validation methods"
- "leverage best practices" ‚Üí "use proven methods"

### What Claude Code Assistant CANNOT Auto-Fix (User Required)

These require human judgment or fact-checking:

- **Section 1 (Citations):** Hallucinated sources require human verification
- **Section 3 (Opinion Attribution):** "Many experts say" needs specific citation or deletion
- **Section 5 (Register Drift):** Requires human judgment of technical level
- **Section 6 (Textbook-perfect punctuation):** Needs human assessment of whether to introduce variation
- **Section 8 (Abrupt Cutoffs):** Incomplete thoughts need content completion
- **Section 9 (Structural Repetition):** Organizational issues need rewrite

## Output Format for Auto-Fixes

When auto-fixing, Claude Code assistant MUST report using this format:

```markdown
### Auto-Fix Report: [filename]

**Field:** title_en
**Original:** "Pioneering solutions for groundbreaking research integrity"
**Fixed:** "Solutions for research integrity verification"
**Violations Fixed:**
  - Section 2: Removed "pioneering" (puffery)
  - Section 2: Removed "groundbreaking" (puffery)

**Provenance Updated:**
  - provenance: "ai-generated" ‚Üí "ai-generated-fixed"
  - autoFixCount: 2
  - lastEdited: 2025-10-27T14:35:00Z

  - Section 11: Replaced semantic evasion with specific language

**Provenance Updated:**
  - provenance: "ai-generated" ‚Üí "ai-generated-fixed"
  - autoFixCount: 3

---

### Items Requiring Manual Review

**Field:** disclaimer
**Issue:** Section 1 - Possible hallucinated citation (line 42: "According to UNESCO 2023 guidelines...")
**Action Required:** Verify citation exists or remove

**Field:** description_en
**Issue:** Section 6 - Textbook-perfect punctuation detected; assess if natural variation needed
**Action Required:** Review punctuation style for human variation

**CANNOT AUTO-FIX - User must review and approve/reject/edit**
```

---

## Provenance State Machine

```
ai-generated
    ‚Üì (auto-fix applied)
ai-generated-fixed
    ‚Üì (user reviews and approves)
human-edited
    ‚Üì (user verifies accuracy)
human-verified ‚úì APPROVED
```

**Enforcement Rule:** Content with `provenance: "ai-generated"` or `"ai-generated-fixed"` CANNOT be committed until user reviews and changes to `"human-edited"`.

---

## Detection Rules (Sections 1-12)

### 1. Hallucinated / Broken / Misaligned Citations

**Definition:** AI fabricates or misuses citations: nonexistent DOIs, mismatched titles, unrelated URLs.

**Red Flags:**
- Hyper-specific citations that fail verification
- URLs that 404 or point to unrelated content
- "Peer-reviewed study" claims backed by blogs
- Invented think tanks or institutes

**Auto-Fix:** CANNOT auto-fix (requires human verification)

**Required Action:**
- Verify every cited claim
- If no verifiable source, reframe as internal data or delete
- BLOCK PUBLISH if source mismatch unresolved

---

### 2. Puffery / Promotional Exaggeration

**Definition:** AI inflates importance without evidence.

**Red Flags:**
- Promotional vocabulary: "pioneering," "groundbreaking," "seminal," "acclaimed," "celebrated," "renowned," "transformative," "dynamic"
- Emphasis phrases: "reflects broader implications," "key turning point," "indelible mark"

**Auto-Fix:** YES - Replace with concrete alternatives
- "groundbreaking" ‚Üí "proven"
- "pioneering" ‚Üí "early"
- "acclaimed" ‚Üí "recognized"

**Example:**
- ‚ùå "Our groundbreaking multilingual pipeline ensures unparalleled trust."
- ‚úÖ "We audit multilingual training data to surface bias before deployment."

---

### 3. Vague Opinion Attribution

**Definition:** Anonymous authorities ("many experts") used for credibility.

**Red Flags:**
- "Many scholars agree..." without names
- "Some experts warn..." with no citation
- "It is widely believed..." statements

**Auto-Fix:** CANNOT auto-fix (needs specific citation)

**Required Action:**
- Cite named source or rewrite as GeoVerity position
- Delete filler phrases

---

### 4. Templatey Discourse Markers

**Definition:** LLM overuse of rhythmic templates.

**Red Flags:**
- Boilerplate closers: "Overall," "In summary," "Ultimately"
- Chains: "not only... but also... and ultimately..."
- Sequential "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"
- **Negative parallelism**: "Not just X, but Y" constructions

**Auto-Fix:** YES - Remove boilerplate, rewrite negative parallelism

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå "Not just compliance, but transformation."
- ‚úÖ "Comprehensive compliance verification."
- ‚ùå "Moreover, we provide..."
- ‚úÖ "We also provide..." / remove transition

---

### 5. Register Drift and Identity Drift

**Definition:** Slips between registers mid-document.

**Red Flags:**
- Service page lapsing into scholarly jargon
- Insights article dropping into sales copy
- Sudden register shift (B2 business ‚Üí C2 theory)

**Auto-Fix:** CANNOT auto-fix (requires human judgment)

**Required Action:**
- Check against `languaging` register matrix
- Remove letter-writing formulas
- BLOCK PUBLISH if register breaks

---

### 6. Formatting / Typography Artifacts

**Definition:** AI output carries noncompliant formatting.

**Red Flags:**
- Bold-colon bullets: "**Data Integrity:** We ensure..."
- Title Case where sentence case expected
- "Here's what we'll cover:" scaffolding
- Curly quotes where straight quotes required
- Emojis (üî•, üöÄ, ‚úÖ)
- **Textbook-perfect punctuation**: Mechanically perfect but unnaturally consistent

**Auto-Fix:** YES (except textbook-perfect punctuation)
- Strip emojis
- Convert curly ‚Üí straight quotes
- Remove bold-colon bullets
- Fix Title Case ‚Üí sentence case
- FLAG ONLY: Textbook-perfect punctuation (user reviews)

---

### 7. Meta-Chatbot Voice

**Definition:** Assistant meta-talk signals AI authorship.

**Red Flags:**
- "As an AI..."
- "I can't access real-time data..."
- "Here is your requested overview..."
- "Happy to help!"

**Auto-Fix:** YES - Delete entirely

---

### 8. Abrupt Cutoffs / Fragmented Sections

**Definition:** LLM drafts stop mid-thought.

**Red Flags:**
- Lists ending at "3." with no preceding items
- Paragraphs ending mid-sentence
- Promised sections missing

**Auto-Fix:** CANNOT auto-fix (requires content completion)

**Required Action:** BLOCK PUBLISH if truncated

---

### 9. Structural Repetition

**Definition:** Monotonous rhythm, uniform paragraph length.

**Red Flags:**
- Identical paragraph structure throughout
- Every paragraph opening with same connective
- Dense nominalization chains

**Auto-Fix:** CANNOT auto-fix (requires organizational rewrite)

**Required Action:**
- Introduce rhythm variation
- Replace nominalizations with verbs

---

### 10. Text Detection Tiers

Apply Tiers 1-4 in addition to Sections 1-9.

#### Tier 1: Lexical & Phrasal Scan (AUTO-FIX)
- Promotional vocab: "renowned," "cutting-edge," "transformative"
- AI verbiage: "delve," "intricate tapestry," "navigating the landscape"
- Didactic throat-clearing: "It is important to note"

#### Tier 2: Syntactic & Structural (MIXED)
- Rule-of-three triads (auto-fix)
- Negative parallelism (auto-fix)
- Textbook-perfect punctuation (FLAG ONLY)
- Flat cadence (FLAG ONLY)

#### Tier 3: Semantic & Content (FLAG ONLY)
- Generic filler content
- Lack of nuance
- False ranges

#### Tier 4: Technical & Factual (CANNOT AUTO-FIX)
- Validate DOIs, ISBNs
- Test external links
- Confirm entities exist

---

### 11. Anti-Detection Evasion Artifacts

#### 11.1. Awkward Synonymy (AUTO-FIX)
- ‚ùå "facilitate epistemic evaluation" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "verify claims"
- ‚ùå "institutions necessitate assistance" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "institutions need help"

#### 11.2. Semantic Evasion (FLAG ONLY)
- ‚ùå "The compliance framework integrates verification while ensuring systematic validation approaches..."
- Requires human rewrite with specific claims

#### 11.3. Structural Inconsistencies (FLAG ONLY)
- Choppy fragmentation or run-on merges
- Requires human rhythm assessment

#### 11.4. Character-Level Perturbations (AUTO-FIX)
- Strip homoglyphs, zero-width spaces, lookalikes
- BLOCK PUBLISH if detected
