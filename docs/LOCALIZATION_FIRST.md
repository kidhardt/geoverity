# LOCALIZATION_FIRST (GeoVerity 2026)

- Every public page must exist in English ("/...") and Spanish ("/es/...").
- hreflang and canonical links must reference each other.
- Each page must expose:
  - translationStatus ("up-to-date", "placeholder", "needs-review")
  - lastReviewed (ISO timestamp)
- Spanish placeholders must be flagged and remediated; no indefinite lag.
- Each page must have a machine-readable JSON twin for both languages (feeds search, accessibility, and future React islands).
