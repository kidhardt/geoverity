# GeoVerity Language Register Plan

**Document Type:** Sociolinguistic Register Specification
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Effective:** January 2026
**Author:** GeoVerity Content Strategy Team
**Reviewed by:** Linguistics PhD Stakeholder

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes a **register stratification framework** for GeoVerity's digital content surfaces, grounded in systemic functional linguistics (Halliday & Matthiessen) and audience design theory (Bell). The framework addresses the critical mismatch between **academically rigorous language** (appropriate for scholarly discourse in the Insights journal) and **professional plain language** (required for service marketing pages targeting non-specialist administrators and project managers).

**Core Principle:** Register selection must be **audience-driven** and **genre-appropriate**, not uniformly applied across all content surfaces.

---

## Theoretical Framework

### Register as Social Semiotic

Following Hallidayan systemic functional linguistics, register is conceptualized as contextual variation in language determined by three dimensions:

1. **Field** (subject matter): What is being discussed
2. **Tenor** (social roles): Relationship between writer and reader
3. **Mode** (channel): Medium of communication

### Register Continuum

GeoVerity content surfaces occupy multiple positions along the **elaborated ↔ restricted code continuum** (Bernstein 1971), calibrated to audience expertise and communicative purpose:

```
[Restricted/Informal] ←―――――――――――――――――――――→ [Elaborated/Formal]
    Homepage Hero          Services Pages      Technical Docs      Insights Journal
    (B1-B2 CEFR)          (B2-C1 CEFR)        (C1 CEFR)          (C1-C2 CEFR)
```

## Lexical Stratification Guidelines

### Tier 1: Universal Vocabulary (All Surfaces)
**Criteria:** General Service List (GSL) 2000 most frequent English words
**Examples:** "data," "quality," "verify," "trust," "help," "service," "system"
**Usage:** Homepage, Services, Contact

### Tier 2: Professional Vocabulary (Services + Insights)
**Criteria:** Academic Word List (AWL) + Industry-standard terms
**Examples:** "methodology," "framework," "evaluation," "governance," "compliance," "integrity"
**Usage:** Services Hub, Pillar/Spoke pages, Insights Hub

### Tier 3: Technical Vocabulary (Spokes + Insights Posts)
**Criteria:** Domain-specific terminology (AI/ML, Education, Policy)
**Examples:** "fine-tuning," "RLHF," "epistemic warrant," "IRB compliance," "hreflang," "transformer architecture"
**Usage:** Service Spoke pages, Insights Posts (defined on first use in Services)

### Tier 4: Disciplinary Jargon (Insights Posts ONLY)
**Criteria:** Specialized scholarly terminology
**Examples:** "phenomenological," "Bakhtinian dialogism," "deontological," "hermeneutic," "sociolinguistic variation"
**Usage:** Insights Journal Posts ONLY (not defined, assumes expert audience)

---

## Information Structure Principles

### Given-New Contract (Halliday)
All content surfaces should follow the **given-before-new** information structure:
- Place known/contextual information in theme position (sentence-initial)
- Place new/focal information in rheme position (sentence-final)

**Example (Services Page):**
- ✅ "Graduate programs [given] face new challenges from AI authorship [new]. These challenges [given] require updated integrity frameworks [new]."
- ❌ "Updated integrity frameworks are required by challenges that graduate programs face."

### Thematic Progression
**Homepage:** Constant theme (GeoVerity as repeated subject)
- "GeoVerity provides... GeoVerity verifies... GeoVerity helps..."

**Services Pages:** Linear theme (previous rheme becomes next theme)
- "AI systems require verified data [rheme]. Verified data [theme] enables trustworthy models [rheme]. Trustworthy models [theme] build institutional confidence."

**Insights Posts:** Split theme (complex thematic development)
- Academic argumentation allows non-linear thematic progression

---

## Code-Switching & Bilingual Parity

### English-Spanish Register Alignment
**Critical:** Spanish translations must match the register of English source text.

**Register-Appropriate Translation:**

| English (Services Page, B2-C1) | Spanish (Same Register) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| "GeoVerity helps institutions maintain epistemic integrity." | "GeoVerity ayuda a las instituciones a mantener la integridad epistémica." |
| **NOT:** "GeoVerity auxilia a instituciones en el mantenimiento de la integridad epistémica." (too formal) |

| English (Insights Post, C1-C2) | Spanish (Same Register) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| "The epistemic collapse induced by LLM-generated text necessitates institutional recalibration." | "El colapso epistémico inducido por texto generado por LLM necesita una recalibración institucional." |

**Register Calibration by Variety:**
- **Latin American Spanish:** Prefer slightly more direct/informal register than Peninsular Spanish
- **Peninsular Spanish:** Acceptable for formal Insights Posts
- **Avoid:** Overly formal constructions in service pages ("se ruega," "a la mayor brevedad posible")

---

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms

### Pre-Publication Register Audit

**Automated Checks:**
1. **Sentence length analysis:** Flag sentences >30 words on Homepage/Services pages
2. **Passive voice detection:** Flag >15% passive on non-Insights pages
3. **Lexical density calculation:** Flag mismatches with target range
4. **Readability scores:** Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, CEFR alignment

**Human Review:**
1. **Linguistic review:** PhD-level linguist reviews register appropriateness
2. **Audience testing:** Segment representatives review drafts (administrators, PMs, researchers)
3. **Cross-linguistic review:** Native Spanish speaker reviews register parity

### Post-Publication Analytics
- **Time on page:** Low time-on-page for Services pages may indicate register mismatch (too complex)
- **Bounce rate:** High bounce on Services pages may indicate cognitive overload
- **Heatmaps:** Track reading patterns for subordinate-initial sentences (often skipped)

---

## Implementation Workflow

### Content Creation Process

1. **Surface Identification:** Determine content surface type (Homepage, Services, Insights, etc.)
2. **Register Selection:** Apply specifications from this document
3. **Draft Creation:** Write in target register
4. **Automated Audit:** Run readability/register checks
5. **Human Review:** Linguistic + audience review
6. **Translation:** Spanish version at equivalent register
7. **Publication:** Deploy with metadata (`registerLevel: "B2-C1"`)

### Metadata Schema
All content files should include register metadata:

```yaml

- Graduate-level vocabulary and complex syntax in scholarly articles
- Citations and references for claims
- Methodology explanations for technical audiences
- **Service pages:** Use professional plain language (B2-C1) for administrators and project managers
```

**Add new subsection:**
```markdown
**Register-Appropriate Language:**
- **Homepage/Services pages:** Plain professional language (B2-C1 CEFR)
  - Active voice, SVO order, main clause initial
  - Define technical terms on first use
  - Target: Administrators and project managers who value clear, actionable language
- **Insights Posts:** Academic register (C1-C2 CEFR)

  - Target: Researchers and thought leaders expecting scholarly argumentation
- See [Language Register Plan](../docs/Language-Register-Plan.md) for full specifications
```

## Glossary of Linguistic Terms

**CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages):** Standardized scale of language proficiency (A1-C2)

**Lexical Density:** Ratio of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to total words; higher density = more information-packed

**Nominalization:** Converting verbs/adjectives into nouns (e.g., "verify" → "verification"); increases abstraction and formality

**Embedding Depth:** Number of subordinate clauses nested within a sentence; higher depth = greater syntactic complexity

**Thematic Structure:** Division of clause into theme (sentence-initial, given information) and rheme (new information)

**Subordinate Clause Initial:** Sentence structure where dependent clause precedes main clause (e.g., "While X, Y...")

**Hedging:** Use of epistemic modality to express uncertainty or tentativeness (e.g., "may," "suggests," "arguably")

**Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL):** Hallidayan framework analyzing language as social semiotic shaped by field, tenor, mode

**Register:** Contextual variety of language associated with particular situations, audiences, and purposes

**Tenor:** Social relationship between discourse participants (formal ↔ informal, expert ↔ novice)

**Field:** Subject matter or domain of discourse (technical, academic, everyday)

**Mode:** Channel of communication (spoken, written, digital)
